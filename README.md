In this project, I analyzed pizza sales data using SQL, focusing on data cleaning and implementing advanced SQL techniques like joins, subqueries, and window functions. The project involved transforming raw sales data into meaningful insights by removing duplicates, handling missing values, and optimizing queries for performance. Key analyses included sales trends, customer preferences, and product performance, providing actionable insights for business decision-making.
